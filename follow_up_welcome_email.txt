Hi All,

Well done to those of you who have already been through the installation instructions and introduced yourselves in the forum. If you haven't already started, please try and take a look today - it shouldn't take that long, but if you hit a problem you will need time to ask in the forum and sort it out. We have a lot to get through, so it's really important you're ready to go on Tuesday!

Although we will normally start the class at 6.30pm, we will be starting at 6pm this Tuesday. You will need to bring your laptop with you to the class. We're in a room around the back of the Careers Service - it should be clearly signposted. 

Finally, if you're no longer intending to take the course, please let me know asap so I can allocate your place to someone on the waiting list.

See you Tuesday!
